# My notes TODO
## Features
- remove default mapping
- add mapping submenu
- let's attenuverter to be set even if there is no mapping -> for default no input plaits behavior (internal envelope mod)
- for level -> new custom item ? -> cannot be changed with encoder only mapped or not and get value from CV
- choose midi channel
- if level is patched -> count trigger as unplugged


## midi additional features
- sustain for envelope (except in drum engines) -> seem already OK but because of no polyphony
- polyphony on some engines
- velocity mod lvl in sub menu ? modwheel ? CCs ?

## Other additional features
- two modulators (CV OUTs) -> envelope copy / LFO (with config submenu ?)
